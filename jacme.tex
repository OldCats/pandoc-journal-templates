    {\parindent 2em Injury is a leading cause of death among young adults. An accurately
implemented filed triage scheme (FTS) by emergency medical technicians
(EMTs) is the first step for delivering right patients to the right
hospital. However, the training effect of FTS on EMTs with different
levels and backgrounds has scarcely been reported. We evaluated training
effects of FTS among EMTs in Taipei. Standard FTS contains physiologic
status, anatomical sites of injury, and mechanism of injury criteria.
The intervention was a 30-minute lecture and pre-and-post tests, each
containing five questions about trauma severity judgment (i.e.,
mechanism of injury {[}2 questions{]}, anatomic sites of injury {[}2
questions{]}, and physiological status {[}1 question{]}). The change in
EMT accuracy was measured before and after training. Subgroup analyses
were performed across EMTs with different levels and seniorities. From
September 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016, 821 EMTs were enrolled, including
740 EMT-intermediates and 81 paramedics. Overall, EMT accuracy improved
after the intervention in the intermediate (73.2\% vs.~85.5\%, p
\textless{} 0.05) and paramedic (76.0\% vs.~85.7\%, p \textless{} 0.01)
groups. All trainees showed improvements in physiology and mechanism
criteria, but paramedics showed decreased accuracy in anatomic criteria.
The subgroup analysis showed that accuracy positively associated with
prehospital care experience for major trauma cases 1 year before the
training course, and the anatomical criterion accuracy was adversely
associated with paramedic seniority. Field triage training can improve
EMT accuracy for FTS. The anatomical aspect is more diffi cult to
improve and should be emphasized in FTS training courses.}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

{Injury is the ninth leading cause of death in the world, and the leading
cause of death in young people.\textsuperscript{{[}1{]}} Rapid
transporting a severely-injured patient to an appropriate trauma center
reduces his/her risk of mortality by 25\%\textsuperscript{{[}2{]}}
because prolonged prehospital time is associated with worsen
outcome,\textsuperscript{{[}3{]}} and that relies on accurate field
triage decisions by emergency medical technicians (EMTs). In many
countries, emergency medical service (EMS) systems develop field triage
scheme (FTS) in reference to the US FTS.\textsuperscript{{[}4{]}}
Although the US FTS guides the destination facility choice by a stepwise
evaluation of physiologic status (P), anatomical injury (A), injury
mechanism (M), and special consideration of the injured patient, EMTs'
responses to P, A, and M criteria may differ.\textsuperscript{{[}2{]}}

Currently, no study has investigated field triage training of EMTs.
Here, we evaluated whether a single training program improves field
triage accuracy and learning outcomes among FTS sub-aspects.}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{study-design-and-setting}{%
\subsection{Study Design and Setting}\label{study-design-and-setting}}

This is a before-and-after study. We held seven field triage trainings
for Taipei EMTs from September 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016 for all
intermediate and paramedic EMTs in Taipei City. Taipei City is a
metropolitan area with 2.65 million registered individuals over 272
km\textsuperscript{2} , including about 3.00 million inflow daytime
workers. There are 973 intermediates and 89 paramedics in Taipei City
and up to 49,000 annual trauma-related missions.

\hypertarget{irb-approval}{%
\subsection{IRB Approval}\label{irb-approval}}

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
National Taiwan University Hospital.

\hypertarget{exposure-definition}{%
\subsection{Exposure Definition}\label{exposure-definition}}

Participants were exposed to a 30-minute lecture and underwent pre- and
post-tests. The pre-test and post-test were comprised of five
single-choice questions based on a scenario with trauma patient. Each
question regard to mechanism of injury (M; 2 questions), anatomic injury
sites (A; 2 questions), or physiological status (P; 1 question). A
medical director team in Taipei City designed the lecture and test
contents. Although the scenarios were different in preand post-test,
these two scenarios were designed by the medical director team with the
consensus of the degree of difficulty to guarantee comparability.

The seniority and major trauma experience among the paramedics were also
recorded to test the association with a training effect. The seniority
is comprised of ``EMT seniority'' (i.e., the period from the certificate
of EMT basic) and ``Paramedic seniority'' (i.e., the period from the
certification of EMT-P). The reason to divide the seniority is that we
think both the occupational years (EMT seniority with multi-tasking
duty) and expertise experience (paramedic seniority merely focusing on
the ambulance run) might differently affect their learning.

\hypertarget{outcomes}{%
\subsection{Outcomes}\label{outcomes}}

The primary outcome was the test accuracy comparison before and after
training. The secondary outcomes included EMT level and seniority.

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical Analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

Data entered in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) was processed and
analyzed by SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Descriptive population statistics were given as counts, percentages, or
mean ± standard deviation. We used the McNemar and Mann--Whitney rank
sum tests for comparisons. A two-tailed p-value \textless{} 0.05 was
considered significant. We examined the correlation between accuracy and
(1) seniority, (2) experience of major trauma mission, and (3) major
trauma mission within 1 year using Pearson correlations.

The baseline field triage accuracy for all EMS providers was 73.51\% and
rose to 85.6\% after training (p \textless{} 0.05). Overall accuracy
improved after intervention in the intermediate (73.2\% vs.~85.5\%, p
\textless{} 0.05) and paramedic (76.0\% vs.~85.7\%, p \textless{} 0.01)
groups, which presented higher mechanism and physiological aspect
post-test accuracies, but not higher anatomical aspects. The trend of
anatomical question performance worsened in the paramedic group, but was
not statistically significant (82.0\% vs.~80.9\%, p = 0.87) in revised
Table 2. To determine the impact of seniority, we divided paramedics
into subgroups (Table 3). Significant mechanism aspect improvements were
observed in all subgroups. Physiological aspect performance was not
statistically significant but tended to improve. The anatomical aspect
accuracy non-significantly declined after training in the high seniority
subgroup. We analyzed the association between field triage and
experience in the paramedic group and found a significant correlation
between ``major trauma mission within 1 year'' and pretest/posttest
accuracy (p = 0.037/0.002).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The single FTS training program significantly improved overall
prehospital field triage decision accuracy. Improvement was achieved
mainly in mechanical and physiological criteria. To our knowledge, this
is the first study to evaluate different FTS aspects among EMTs, and our
results are informative for FTS training courses. In our study, major
trauma within 1 year positively impacted field triage. This was
supported by David and Brachet's study, which found that more than 2
years of field experience plus past and recent trauma patient volume
associated with prehospital interval
reductions.\textsuperscript{{[}4{]}} However, the anatomical aspect
accuracy decreased in the paramedic group, especially for those with
higher seniority, which seems to thwart educational improvement. Most
senior paramedics incorrectly answered the post-test question that
pictured a javelin penetrating the calf (Fig 2), misleading to
over-triage this case to a trauma center, while a penetrating distal
limb injury does not meet trauma center transportation criteria.
However, there is a proviso, ``when in doubt, transport to a trauma
center''.\textsuperscript{{[}3{]}} Even though senior paramedics
incorrectly answered this question; this over-triage is acceptable in
clinical practice. The US-FTS evaluates injured patients step by step.
However, studies that have discussed the prehospital triage
decision-making model revealed that the information obtained before
contacting the patient (early visual cues from the scene, mechanism of
injury, and patient appearance) play more important roles than further
assessment (defi nite vital signs, non-obvious anatomic injury, and
detail history) in decision
making.;\textsuperscript{{[}5{]}}\textsuperscript{{[}6{]}} ``EMT gut
feeling'' refers to the ``EMS provider judgment'' criteria that was the
last criteria added into the ACS COT (American College of Surgeons
Committee on Trauma) decision scheme in 2006 and is the last triage
scale step. However, it is also the most commonly cited (40.0\%) and
sometimes the only used (21.4\%) criterion.5 The value of EMS provider
judgement criteria varies between sites, modestly increases overtriage,
and plays an important role in identifying high risk patients who are
missed by physiologic and anatomic
criteria.;\textsuperscript{{[}5{]}}\textsuperscript{{[}6{]}} In our
study, the post-test penetration question is sanguineous and makes the
trainees follow their gut feeling and triage the patient to the trauma
center rather than apply the anatomical step. Further training programs
should put more emphasis on avoiding EMT judgments that increase
overtriage rates and impact emergency care efficacy.

Fig. 2. One of the questions in the post-test that made many senior
paramedics overtriage.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

Our study has several limitations. First, the number of paramedics was
limited. Second, the seniority and major trauma experience among the EMT
intermediates were not recorded. Hence, the association between the
seniority of EMT intermediates and its training effect cannot be
evaluated. Third, training course impact was evaluated based on the
tests, not clinical performance. Finally, the cut point of 12 years (in
EMT seniority) and 5 years (in paramedic year) was not based on medical
evidence but for the middle point of the data distribution to enhance
the comparability. Actually, there was scarce evidence about the
association between the EMT seniority and their trauma triage
performance; therefore, we just choice the median year as the cut point.
Further studies should focus on the EMT seniority and their clinical
performance.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

The training course improves the field triage accuracy in Taipei City.
Anatomical FTS aspects are more difficult to improve by a single
training program, especially in senior paramedics. Future teaching
programs should emphasize FTS anatomy aspects.
